# INTRODUCTION
The field of data engineering is becoming more and more important in the dynamic world of data-driven decision-making. Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from many sources to relevant destinations is made easier by data pipelines, which constitute the foundation of workflows for data processing. With the help of the potent mix of Python and Apache NiFi, this project is designed for beginners and will walk you through the process of creating a simple yet informative data pipeline.
