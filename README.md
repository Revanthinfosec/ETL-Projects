# INTRODUCTION
The field of data engineering is becoming more and more important in the dynamic world of data-driven decision-making. Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from many sources to relevant destinations is made easier by data pipelines, which constitute the foundation of workflows for data processing. With the help of the potent mix of Python and Apache NiFi, this project is designed for beginners and will walk you through the process of creating a simple yet informative data pipeline.

# Project synopsis:-

Assisting novices in data engineering with practical knowledge of building a fundamental ETL data pipeline is the main objective of this project. The user-friendly data integration tool Apache NiFi will coordinate the pipeline, which will include obtaining data from a source, modifying it with Python scripts, and loading the changed data into a destination.


# Technology and Instruments:-

Python: A general-purpose programming language that is widely used for data-related activities due to its ease of use and versatility.
Apache NFI: An open-source data integration tool called Apache NiFi has an intuitive user interface that makes it possible to create intricate data flows.
SQLLite: SQLite is a simple relational database that is lightweight and appropriate for small to medium-sized applications. It is the database used in this example for beginners.

# Process to start the code into work:-

Install Apache NiFi first: Apache NiFi is a powerful platform that makes data flow design and automation easier. The data pipeline's many phases will be seamlessly coordinated with the help of this technology.

Python Data Extraction: Using source_data.csv, a CSV file, or any other basic data source, choose a Python script (extract.py) that will extract data from the source.

Python Data Transformation: Create the transform.py script to apply a fundamental transformation to the extracted data. This phase demonstrates how versatile Python is for modifying and improving data as needed.


Data Loading using Python and SQLite: Script the loading of the converted data into a database using Python once again. Because of its simplicity and convenience of use, SQLite (load.py) is used in this example.

Configure Apache NiFi for ETL: Create a data flow by utilizing its graphical user interface. In order to do this, processors for data extraction, transformation, and loading must be configured. This results in a pipeline diagram.

Set Up NiFi Processors: Go into the specifics of setting up each NiFi processor, including input/output pathways, script paths, and database connection information. Ensuring that data flows through the pipeline seamlessly depends on this phase.

Run the NiFi Flow: Run the NiFi flow, watching as data passes through each pipeline step. Real-time confirmation of the pipeline's functionality is made possible by NiFi's monitoring capabilities.

Confirm the Outcomes: Verify the destination database that the modified data has loaded successfully. This stage functions as a concrete verification of the full ETL procedure.

# Summary:
In summary, this project gives novices a hands-on understanding of the basic principles of data engineering. You may develop a solid grasp of ETL processes—a crucial skill set in the dynamic field of data engineering—by combining the flexibility of Python scripting with the visual orchestration capabilities of Apache NiFi. As your skills develop, you may investigate more complex functions, modify the pipeline to accommodate other data sources, and include other tools to further your knowledge in the area.
